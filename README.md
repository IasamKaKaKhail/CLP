Compiler Lab Project.


Lexical Analysis (Tokenization):-
 
Implemented a lexical analyser that breaks input strings into tokens based on the grammar rules. Each token represents a meaningful unit of the input language.
Utilizing regular expressions to match input patterns and generate tokens accordingly.
Ensuring that the lexical analyser can handle whitespace, comments, and other irrelevant characters.
 
Parsing Algorithm:-
 
Choose a parsing algorithm (recursive descent, LL(1)) that suits the complexity of our grammar.
Implemented the parsing algorithm using object-oriented design principles. Define classes to represent the grammar rules, parse tree nodes, and other relevant components.
Implemented functionality for parsing input tokens and constructing a parse tree or generating parse results.
